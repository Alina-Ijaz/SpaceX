              Most engineers and scientists agree that this an extremely exciting
              and busy time to be working in the space industry. Several new things
              are happening above the Earth’s atmosphere. Tourists can now pay
              private companies for a short trip to space, private industry is
              developing spacecraft for NASA missions, and a robotic helicopter is
              currently exploring Mars.

              NASA and private companies also have their sights set on the moon.
              NASA’s Artemis program has a goal of landing humans on the moon in
              2025 to begin building a base camp. This long-term human presence on
              the lunar surface will help NASA prepare for human space exploration
              missions of greater distance and duration, including an eventual
              crewed flight to Mars.

              “One of the big questions currently being investigated is how humans
              may be able to use resources from the moon in future missions,” said
              Ho. “For instance, can lunar ice be converted to drinking water or to
              make rocket fuel? If so, new processes such as these will play a role
              in the design of future space missions and spacecraft. They would
              allow humans to pick up resources from the moon on the way to Mars.”

              In addition to utilizing lunar resources, there are other challenges
              to overcome if people will someday have extended stays on the moon.
              For more than 20 years, NASA has had a safe, continuous human presence
              240 miles above Earth on the International Space Station. The moon,
              however, is 244,000 miles away from the planet.
