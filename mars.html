                            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System,
                            being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god
                            of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's)
                            , and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a
                            core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys,
                            dunes, and polar ice caps.

                            Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano
                            and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of
                            the largest canyons in the Solar System. The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere
                            covers
                            approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature.[20] Days and seasons on
                            Mars
                            are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of
                            the
                            rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot
                            exist

                            Mars can be viewed from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. This
                            appearance, due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars often
                            being called the Red Planet.[26][27] It is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky,
                            with an apparent magnitude that reaches âˆ’2.94, comparable to that of Jupiter and
                            surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[15] Historically, Mars has been observed
                            since ancient times, and over the millennia, has been featured in culture and the arts
                            in ways that have reflected humanity's growing knowledge of it.
