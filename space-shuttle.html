              In April 1981, the launch of the space shuttle Columbia ushered in a
              period of reliance on the reusable shuttle for most civilian and
              military space missions. Twenty-four successful shuttle launches
              fulfil


              led many scientific and military requirements until Jan.
              28,1986, when just 73 seconds after liftoff, the space shuttle
              Challenger exploded.

              The Columbia disaster was the second shuttle tragedy. On Feb. 1, 2003,
              the shuttle broke apart while reentering the Earth’s atmosphere,
              killing all seven crew members. An investigation determined the catastrophe was caused by a
              piece of foam insulation that broke off the shuttle’s propellant tank
              and damaged the edge of the shuttle’s left wing. It was the second
              loss of a shuttle in 113 shuttle flights. After each of the disasters,
              space shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two
              years.

              Discovery was the first of the three active space shuttles to be
              retired, completing its final mission on March 9, 2011; Endeavour did
              so on June 1. The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing
              of Atlantis on July 21, 2011, closing the 30-year space shuttle
              program.

              The Gulf War proved the value of satellites in modern conflicts.
              During this war, allied forces were able to use their control of the
              “high ground” of space to achieve a decisive advantage. Satellites
              were used to provide information on enemy troop formations and
              movements, early warning of enemy missile attacks, and precise
              navigation in the featureless desert terrain.
